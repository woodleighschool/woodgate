# Companion app

Native iOS client for dedicated check-in terminals. A pairing QR provides the server URL and API key, then the operator selects the terminal's location.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

Open `WoodGate.xcodeproj` and use the shared `WoodGate` scheme, or run the repository tasks from the parent directory:

```bash
mise run //app:fmt-check
mise run //app:lint
mise run //app:build
```

## 📦 Releases

App releases use `app-<version>` tags and keep `MARKETING_VERSION` in `Config/Version.xcconfig`. We distribute production builds through App Store Connect as a private Custom App.
